## Earthquake Prediction Model

**Used Libraries-** Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Basemap, Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow


Predicting earthquake is one of the biggest unsolved problems of earth sciences (and it requires analyzing a lot of variables/correlations, most of which are unknown). Some regions have frequent earthquakes, but this is only a comparative amount compared to other regions. So, predicting the earthquake with date and time, latitude and longitude from previous data is not an ideal approach that follows like other things. It happens naturally and is still very difficult to predict or estimate its parameters.

However, in this project I'll try a simplistic approach to build a earthquake prediction model based on previous earthquake data using machine learning and python.

This earthquake prediction model utilizes machine learning to learn from the old earthquakes data. This notebook also contains a world map visualization where earthquake frequency is plotted. This neural network model can be used to predict earthquakes, even though to a limited extent and a lot of data related to other variables are also required (or should be considered) to improve it even further.

In the notebook file, important processsing/analyzing details are provided at every step.
